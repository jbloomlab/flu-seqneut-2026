# README
This repository designs HA insert sequences that can be submitted to either 
[Twist Biosciences](https://www.twistbioscience.com/) or [GenScript](https://www.genscript.com) for 
gene fragment synthesis and cloning. These inserts are designed to fit between the BsmBI-v2 cut 
sites in the [Bloom lab vector 5764](./data/5764_pHW_SeqNeutCloningVector_WSNHAflankGFP.gb). They 
should begin after the 19th codon for H3N2 strains or 20th codon for H1N1 strains of WSN upstream 
signal peptide, and continue all the way through the end of the HA coding region, followed by a 
double stop codon and a 16-nucleotide barcode. 

The key output file is 
[./flu-seqneut-2026-barcode-to-strain-testset.csv](./flu-seqneut-2026-barcode-to-strain-testset.csv) 
which contains the strains, strain aliases (for Twist/GenScript), GenBank protein ID, nucelotide 
construct sequence, and barcode.

## Insert design details for H3N2 and H1N1 subtypes
In our design, our H3 HA constructs have an upstream signal peptide from WSN, an HA ectodomain 
matching a currently circulating strain, an endodomain matching a recent H3 consensus sequence, 
and a C-terminal domain from WSN

Our H1 HA constructs are slightly different, with an upstream signal peptide from WSN, an HA 
ectodomain matching a currently circulating strain, and an endodomain and a C-terminal domain also 
from WSN

## Barcode design
We specifically design our barcodes to avoid barcodes used by prior libraries and barcodes starting 
with `GG` due to sequencing issues. Prior libraries are identified in the `config.yml`. 

## Running the analysis
To run the pipeline, build and activate the environment with:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate constructs
```

Then run the analysis notebook `construct_order.py` interactively in Marimo. Note that if a filename 
with specified results is already generated, the code will *not* re-generate that results file. 
This is to prevent overwriting of the nucleotide barcodes linked to each HA insert.
